                <b>Accountant</b><br />
                I was working as an accountant for Renault where I did book keeping, accounts payable, yearly financial report, etc. It's a job where good structure and organization is key.
                It was during this job that I realized that I rather wanted be the one that is creating the systems and started studying as an engineer.
                <br /><br /><b>Croupier</b><br />
                After High School and military service I started working for the casino in Stockholm, Sweden.
                I was always interested in gambling, but it was a costly hobby so I joined the casino instead.
                I learned a lot about customer service and to keep calm in stressful situations.
                The job combined quick thinking, good technique and customer care.
