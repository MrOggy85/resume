              I was an early adopter of Vue and was a Patreon of Evan You in the early days.
              I like the simplicity it brings, the opinionated framework, but yet highly customizable.
              It's a very well thought through framework compared to React.

              It's not my favorite frontend framework since it's trying to use backend
              paradigms in frontend environment which doesn't play well, imho.

              I use Docker on almost a daily basis.
              When deploying any service or frontend it's always bundled in an image.
              It's a great tool to have your service separated from the underlying host OS
              and to avoid installing a lot of dependencies locally or in the host machine.
