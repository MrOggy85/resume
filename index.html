                      Prosieben is one of Europes largest media company.
                      They have several streaming platforms and I was working for one of them.
                      I was hired because their media ingestion were using an inefficient third party monolith
                      application.
                      I was part of a team that was rewriting the monolith into microservices while trying to learn
                      German.
                      In the end we could speed up both the media ingestion and the metadata processing.

                      I joined their frontend team to improve the team performance by introducing agile methology
                      and to transform their old PHP stack into a modern React/Go stack.
                      During my time at Sixt we created a new frontend from scratch and imporved communicating
                      with other teams such as marketing and adwords teams.

              <b>Accountant</b><br />
              I was working as an accountant for Renault where I did book keeping, accounts payable, yearly financial
              report, etc. It's a job where good structure and organization is key.
              It was during this job that I realized that I rather wanted be the one that is creating the systems and
              started studying as an engineer.
              <br /><br /><b>Croupier</b><br />
              After High School and military service I started working for the casino in Stockholm, Sweden.
              I was always interested in gambling, but it was a costly hobby so I joined the casino instead.
              I learned a lot about customer service and to keep calm in stressful situations.
              The job combined quick thinking, good technique and customer care.
